```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(wordcloud)
library(SnowballC)
library(tm)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
zomato <- read.csv("zomato/20190604.csv")
text_corpus <- Corpus(VectorSource(zomato))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
